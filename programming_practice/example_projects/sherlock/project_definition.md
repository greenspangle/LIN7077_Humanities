# My Programming Project - Definition

# The Books of Arthur Colan Doyle

I plan to analyse the language used in the novels of ACD, starting with just a
single book: "A study in Scarlet".

The programming environment I will use is **Anaconda** as this contains Python,
Jupyter notebooks, and all the programming libraries I am likely to use, all set
up and 'ready to go'.

I need a copy of the book as a simple text file and
a simple internet search located the website www.gutenberg.org which has
copyright-free copies of many ACD's books, including "A study in Scarlet".
The many positive reviews and large number of downloads suggest this is a
reliable source of a good copy of the original text.

The outline project plan is:

* Download the book and visually compare sections of the downloaded text against
  a printed copy from the library to confirm:
    * Veracity of the body text
    * Presence or absence of indices, table of contents, preface,
      acknowledgements, and so on that are part of the printed version
    * Presence or absence of chapter titles and subtitles, book sections, etc.
    * The addition of legal disclaimers and 'open source' copyright notices
      added to the downloaded text file by Gutenberg
    * The same with individual page headers and footers e.g, a chapter name on
      each page, page numbers, and whatever else.
* Clean the downloaded file to be just the text of the book. Assuming this is
  not overly complex, I intend to do this manually in a simple text editor
  (notepad or textedit).
* Read the cleaned book file into a single text string.
* Do some simple character counts:
    * Uppercase vs lowercase vs vowels vs consonants vs digits vs punctuation vs
      space vs blank lines, and so on
    * Plot some of these on pie-charts to provide some visual summaries
* Do the same with words
    * Note to self: I will probably need to decide what a word is e.g. is "
      won't" one word or two, same with plurals and possessives.
      I plan to make simple decisions and stick with them for consistency.
    * Word and counts in a table and plotted on a chart
    * Measure word lengths and count length against frequency.
      Put results into a table and on a visual plot.
    * Measure the location and frequency of character names and how those
      characters are distributed through the text.
      Ideally, present that information visually.

Assuming all the above goes to plan (it probably won't!), I'll embody the above
functionality into a set of functions which I can apply to other books by ACD.

I can then investigate how the above measures vary from novel to novel, and over
time.

That's more than plenty to keep me occupied.
