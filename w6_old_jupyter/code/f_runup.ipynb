    "The task is to find the longest 'non-decreasing' sequence of characters in `a_str`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ordering relationship within the collection of characters `{[a-z][0-9]}` is the normal alphabetic ordering with \n",
    "`'a'` being the least, rising to `'z'`, and then the digits from `'0'` to `'9'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, two adjacent characters `a_str[n]` and `a_str[n+1]` in `a_str` are in non-decreasing alphabetical order then the\n",
    "constraint between them is just that `a_str[n] <= a_str[n+1]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is to find the longest such sequence and, if there is more than just one, to find the first.\n",

    "## Design\n",
    "\n",
    "It is often very helpful when trying to solve these more difficult problems to first try and think how it\n",

    "longest sequence found so far\n",

    "current position in string\n",
    "\n",
    "=================== rewrote to here\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",

    "current_longest| the characters in this current non-decreasing run\n",
    "previous_longest| the longest sequence of non-decreasing<br/> characters found so far\n",
    "\n",
    "To start with these are all empty so create them and make them all equal to the empty string `''`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, iterate through `a_str` with a `for` loop. Something like this:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Inside the `for` loop we need an `if` statement to cope with two alternative situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The current non-descending sequence has ended because `current_char` < `previous_char`.<br/>Set\n",
    "   the `current_longest` to just the `current_char`\n",
    "2. The current non-decreasing sequence is still OK because `current_char` >= `previous_char`. <br/> The\n",
    "   current run is still good so add the `current_char` to the end of the `current_longest`.<br/> Compare the\n",
    "   current_longest to the previous_longest and if it's longer make it the `previous_longest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "After the `if` statement assign `current_char` to `previous_char` because it needs to be available for the\n",
    "next iteration.\n",

    "When the for loop finishes the longest run will be held in the variable `previous_longest`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The question asks for the starting position of the longest run. We could do that by iterating\n",
    "through `a_str` again to look for it, but there is an easier way - use the string method `find()`. The\n",
    "question also asks for the length of the longest run - but that's easy, just use `len()`.\n",
