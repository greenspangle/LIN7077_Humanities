# Randomness

Pulling numbers out of a hat, tossing coins, that sort of thing.

The python random library contains many methods for producing random numbers from different distributions,
samples from collections, and rearrangements of collections.

## Integers

The python random library contains many methods for producing pseudo-random numbers. For example, here is
some python to generate a single random integer and a list of random integers between 1 and 9:

```python

import random

# generate a integer
random_integer = random.randint(1, 9)
print('A random integer between 1 and 9:', random_integer)

# generate a list of 10 random integers
random_integer_list_1 = []
for _ in range(10):
    random_integer_list_1.append(random.randint(1, 9))
print('A list of random integers between 1 and 9:', random_integer_list_1)
# do the same using a list comprehension
random_integer_list_2 = [random.randint(1, 9) for _ in range(10)]
print('Another list of random integers between 1 and 9:', random_integer_list_2)
```

## Samples from collections

Pick four cards from the deck - with and without replacement.

```python

import random

deck = 'ace two three four five six seven eight nine ten knave queen king'.split()

# using the choice method to repeatedly choose a random element in the deck
cards_with = [random.choice(deck) for _ in range(23)]
print('Selection of cards with replacement: ', cards_with)

# Use the sample method to select a random sample without replacement
cards_without = random.sample(deck, k=4)  # Select four cards from the deck 
print('Selection of cards with replacement: ', cards_without)

```

## Rearrangements of collections

For example, shuffling a deck of cards and then 'pick a card, any card':

```python
import random

deck = 'ace two three four five six seven eight nine ten knave queen king'.split()
print('\nThe deck of cards is:', deck)
print('The card you have selected is:', random.choice(deck))

# shuffle the deck
random.shuffle(deck)
print('\nThe deck of cards is:', deck)
print('The card you have selected is:', random.choice(deck))

# and shuffle it again
random.shuffle(deck)
print('\nThe deck of cards is:', deck)
print('The card you have selected is:', random.choice(deck))

```

## Random is also available in numpy

A couple of examples. First a list of randon numbers

```python
# numpy library - using the random library

from numpy import random

x = random.randint(100, size=(5))
print(x)

```

Secondly, a scatter-plot of two sets of random points

```python
# import the required libraries 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# generate some random data
x = np.random.randint(10000, size=25)
y = np.random.randint(10000, size=25)

# and plot it
plt.scatter(x, y, color='magenta')

# generate more random data
x = np.random.randint(10000, size=25)
y = np.random.randint(10000, size=25)

# and plot that as well
plt.scatter(x, y, s=5, color='aqua')

# and display it
plt.show()

```

## Pseudo - Randomness

The python random library contains many methods for producing pseudo-random numbers.

They are called pseudo-random numbers because although the numbers have many (most!) of the properties of
random
numbers they are not truly random because they are generated by a deterministic algorithm.

Here is some code to demonstrate the effect:

```python

import random

# set the seed of the random number generator to 1729 (Ramanujan's taxi-cab number)
random.seed(1729)

# generate a lists of random integers, 1 to 9
random_integer_list_1 = []
for _ in range(10):
    random_integer_list_1.append(random.randint(1, 9))
# generate a 2nd list using a comprehension
random_integer_list_2 = [random.randint(1, 9) for _ in range(10)]

# reset the seed
random.seed(1729)

# and now generate another two lists
random_integer_list_3 = [random.randint(1, 9) for _ in range(10)]
random_integer_list_4 = [random.randint(1, 9) for _ in range(10)]

# print them all and compare the values:
print(random_integer_list_1)
print(random_integer_list_2)
print(random_integer_list_3)
print(random_integer_list_4)

```

What that means is that you can use the numbers generated by the random library as if they were truly random
but if your application always needs to use the same sequence of random numbers, prime example of that being
for testing, the random library can do that as well.
