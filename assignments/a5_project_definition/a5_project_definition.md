# LIN7077 Assignment 5

# Write your project proposal

Describe the ideas you intend to explore in your Python project and an
_**outline**_ of the software you plan to build.

There is no fixed format for your project proposal. Do feel free to include
diagrams, bullet lists, back-of-a-napkin-sketches, and so on.

Whatever the structure though, your project proposal should include:

1. The project title.
2. A non-technical description of the topic you will explore and the application
   you will build.
3. An outline of how you intend to approach the project and, possibly, a simple
   plan of how you are going to deliver it.
   The following list is **not** definitive but might help guide your thoughts:
    * The data and text resources you will need and where you expect to get free
      access to them
    * A tentative list of the functions and components you anticipate building
    * How you will test your software to confirm it works correctly
    * Any software libraries you will need
    * Any of many other things that might be particular to your project

250-500 words plus diagrams, sketches, charts, etc.
