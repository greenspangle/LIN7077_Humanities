# Example Project Ideas

The purpose of this project is to showcase your fluency with the programming
language Python. That means that your project should demonstrate you can:

* Reliably write a sequence of Python statements to achieve a stated aim
* Use selection statements and boolean algebra (`if`, `else`, `elif` and the
  boolean operators `and`, `or` and `not`) to choose between options and control
  the flow of execution through your program
* Create collections, add and remove elements to and from them, compare
  collections with each other, and iterate through collections
* Create functions and use them effectively
* Create charts and other graphics to illustrate your data

The linguistic complexity or simplicity of the topic you choose is relatively
speaking unimportant. It needs only to provide a framework around which you can
demonstrate your fluency with Python.

## 'Brexit' trends

Frequency analysis of the word 'Brexit' over time in various publications.

## The vocabulary of the Sherlock Holmes novels of ACD

Word frequency analysis:

* In a single novel
* In every novel, collectively and individually
* How it changed over time and between novels

## Word Usage Trends in Political Speeches

The Economist magazine recently did an analysis of the words used by the leaders
of the Chinese Communist Party in their quinquennial speeches to the party
congresses from 1988-2022 and how the usage of those words had changed over
time. The results were certainly interesting and possibly politically revealing.
See the article
at: [In his reports to the party, Xi Jinping signals change subtly](https://www.economist.com/china/2022/10/20/in-his-reports-to-the-party-xi-jinping-signals-change-subtly)
.

You could do something similar with the annual conference speeches of one or
more British political parties.

## Vocabulary Comparisons over time e.g. 1850 vs 1900

Choose a few text sources or novels that were popular in those time periods and
compare vocabularies.

## Character Frequency trends over time e.g. 1850 vs 1900

Choose a few text sources or novels that were popular in those time periods and
compare letter frequency, and perhaps discern or conjecture some trends.

## Most frequent words occurring near a character

In the Sherlock Holmes novels which words occur 'near' Holmes and which occur '
near' Watson?

What does comparing those 'nearby' words tell us about the relative roles of
those characters in the novels?

Take care with sentence, paragraph and chapter boundaries. If word nearness is
based on a simple measure of 'number of intervening words', then a 'nearby' word
might be in a different chapter.

Perhaps do the same with some romance novels, of different time periods, of
different genres?

## News Media Comparisons

Choose a topic and compare the language used to report that topic by different
news media.

For instance Times vs Telegraph vs Guardian vs Daily Mail vs Sun vs Mirror.
Choose to consider just websites or just printed editions or both.
Do check you have access to the texts.

## Most likely next word

Build a `next_word(a_word)` function that returns the word most likely to follow
a_word or collection of words in an authors works.

Generalise this so that it works for any collection of texts.


## Tokenize(text)

Build a function that returns a list of the individual words in text, minus any
spaces, punctuation, and other 'special' symbols. Hyphenation needs to be
treated carefully.

A difficult extension of this consider that many places and other objects have
names that are more than one word. For example 'Her Majesty', 'Armed Forces', '
Internal Revenue', 'carbon tetrachloride'.

## Sentiment(text)

If 'text' is a product review is it a positive product review or a negative
product review? Is the given number of stars in agreement with the language
used? What to do with reviews that say nothing, perhaps even literally nothing,
but then still give a star rating? How many stars should they get?

Do the same with tweets. Do positive tweets outnumber negative tweets?

## Correlation of review stars and author name

On
30/08/2023 [Trustpilot](https://uk.trustpilot.com/blog/reviews-matter/one-star-five-star-review-names)
posted an interesting analysis on the correlation between a users name and the
number of stars they gave on their review. Obviously the topic is a little
tongue in cheek, but it does make for an interesting and amusing read.

Trustpilot have also blogged about the relative dearth of 2, 3, and 4 star
reviews posted relative to the number of 1's and 5's, possibly because if a user
is motivated enough to leave a review in the first place they probably have a
strong opinion one way or the other.

You could explore the same topic and data.

## Concordance Builder(a_book)

Build a concordance builder for a book.

## Sound_alike(a_word)

Generate alternative spellings of a_word. For example, alternative spellings
of 'fish' are 'ghoti' (gh = /f/ as in enough, o = /i/ as in women, ti= /sh/ as
in nation) and 'fici' (the sound 'fish' is always spelled 'fici' in words whose
base has more than one syllable)

    Dearest creature in Creation,
    Studying English pronunciation,
    I will teach you in my verse
    Sounds like corpse, corps, horse and worse.

## Plagiarism Checker

Content writing is one of the most prolific online businesses. The market lacks
a free tool that can be used
to check for plagiarism in documents. You can use a natural language processing
library along with the
Google search API to create a program that searches the first few pages of
Google and checks for plagiarism.

## email spam filter

Lots of online material to get you started. Many spam filters rely on Bayesian
statistics which is not too
difficult but is mathematical and would be yet another thing to learn.
