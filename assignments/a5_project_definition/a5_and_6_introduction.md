# LIN6209 Introduction to Assignments 5 & 6

Your final two assignments are to specify and then to deliver a small software
development project. These assignments are worth 10% and 50% of your final
assessment respectively.

The two parts do not have to be about the same project but I generally
recommend they are as that will be less work and allow more time to 
explore your own interests in greater depth.

In assignment 5 you outline your project, explain the topics and questions you
intend to examine, and describe how you intend to use Python to explore your
chosen subject computationally.

In assignment 6 you design and build the programs you need, collect your
data resources, and write a project report summarising your work.

**IMPORTANT**\
These two assignments measure your ability to specify, design, build, test, and
deliver a _**software development project**_.

They will _**not**_ be judged on the correctness or otherwise of the linguistic
concepts you propose to investigate.
