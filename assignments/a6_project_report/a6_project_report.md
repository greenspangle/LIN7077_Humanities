# Your Project and Project Report

## Building your project

I strongly recommend you take an iterative development approach to your project.

That means that approximately every two weeks you should go through the whole
development process from start to finish and at the end have something that
'works'.

Even if the first iteration of your project seems embarrassingly trivial,
building it will help clarify your thinking.

When you finish an iteration of your project copy all of your files into a
folder named 'iteration_x' where x is your current version number starting
from 1 and put it in a safe place. That way you always have the previous
version(s) to fall back on if you completely mess up the current version of your
code.

Professional developers use powerful tools to manage this 'version control'
process, examples being GIT/GitHub, CVS, Subversion, and many others.

**I M P O R T A N T**

You must submit your software in a form in which I can execute it.

This can be as an appendix to your project report or as separate files but
whatever option you choose, the code you submit _**MUST**_ be executable by
_**me**_ on my machine.

I need the program scripts with all the settings made explicit so that I can
execute it on my machine. An easy way to test this is to send your project to a
friend and ask them to execute it in their python setup.

## Project Report

About 500-2000 words plus code and diagrams and data.

Your project report should include a 'Project Diary' so first a few words of
guidance on what a project diary is, and what it is not:

* Project diaries are NOT written at the end of the project.
* Project diaries are written in parallel with the application development
  process.
* Project diaries are a contemporaneous record of thoughts, ideas and events as
  they actually happened.
* Project diaries are not a dressed-up 'project report' version of reality.

Your project report should include:

1. The project name
2. A concise non-technical statement of the idea your software development
   project explores. (As this is a repetition of assignment 5 it does not count
   towards word count)
3. The project development report describing your work on the creation of
   this application.
   This will often (but certainly not always) include your work on:
    * analysis and design activities such as breaking the problem into simpler
      objects and functions, defining what they will do, designing those objects
      and functions, deciding how they will work with each other, and how they
      will be tested
    * finding any data you need and getting access to it
    * building the functions and other software
    * testing your software
    * false starts and stuff that did not work
    * stuff that did work
    * changes of direction, scope, etc
4. The results you obtained. This can be presented as text, tables, charts,
   diagrams, graphics, or whatever.
5. Evaluation, reflections, and ideas for improvements
6. If I was doing this project again I would . . . . .

Don't forget:

1. KEEP IT SIMPLE
2. As well as your report you must submit your python code regardless of whether
   it 'works' or not
3. The code MUST be in a form in which I can execute it.
