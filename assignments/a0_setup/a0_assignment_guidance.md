# LIN7077 Guidance for Assignments 1 to 4

## Understanding the problem statements

All four assignments ask you to design, build, test, and deliver a
collection of functions that are each specified in two ways:

* A plain english description of what the function is required to do
* A collection of tests the function must pass

Both are required because:

* Problem descriptions written in natural language are relatively easy to write,
  give a lot of information in a small space, and make it easy to understand the
  general case of what is required.
  However, natural language tends towards ambiguity which is unhelpful in
  situations where exactitude is required.
* Problems written as a collection of test cases are very precise but often make
  it difficult to understand the general case for which the test cases are
  individual examples.

Your functions need to satisfy the requirements of both specifications.
This way of working is called 'Test Driven Development' (TDD) and is a popular
method of modern software development.

## Writing your answers

**IMPORTANT**

* DO NOT change the signature of the function.  
  That means you must not change:
    * the function name
    * the number of parameters
    * the names of the parameters
    * the data-types of the parameters
    * the number of values returned
    * the data-type(s) of the value(s) returned
* All of your functions must be in a single file
* The python script you submit MUST execute
* The name of the python script you submit must be ai_xxxxxxxxx.py where:
    * ai is the assignment number (a1, a2, a3, a4)
    * x...x is your student number

You do not need to follow any of my hints.
Any function that works as specified will gain full marks.

You can include as many 'helper functions' as you want in your answer script and
call them anything you want.

You do not need to submit any of your notes or tests. Just working versions of
the requested functions.

If you cannot work our why your function is failing a test, then come to my
office hour.
