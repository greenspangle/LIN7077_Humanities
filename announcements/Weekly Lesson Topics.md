# Programming for the Humanities
# Weekly Lesson Topics

## Week—1: Getting Started

* Install Python on your computer
* Create an account at Anaconda.com


* Using Python and IDLE
* Saving your work
* Writing Python modules/scripts
* Syntax errors and debugging


* Values
* Variables
* Using functions
* Objects and object types
  * Text: str()
  * Integer numbers: int()
  * Floating point numbers: float()
  * Truth values: bool()
* Operators
  * +, -, *, /, //, %
  * <, <=, ==, !=, >=, >
  * and, or, not
  * [ ], is, in

## Week—2: Functions
What a function is
Built-in functions
Defining a function
  * Name
  * Parameters
  * {'hidden' internal code}
  * Return value
* Saving and reusing functions
  * import
  * from
  * as
* Good programming style 
  * Testing – part I
  * Informal testing
  * The assert statement
  * The unittest library
  * The pytest library

### Programming Practice #1

## Week—3: Conditional execution

* Boolean logic
  * The values True and False
  * The operators and, or, and not 
  * Truth tables

* The conditional keywords
  * if
  * else
  * elif

Testing & TDD (test driven development)


### Programming Practice #2


## Week—4: Collections, Iteration, & Recursion

* Collections
* String, List, Tuple, Set, Frozenset, Dictionary, Queue, Deque, Stack, Tree, Graph, …


* Ordered and unordered collections
* Mutable & Immutable collections 


* Iterating through collections
  * for
  * while
  * break
  * continue


* Analysis of collections
* Count, item lengths, adjacency
* Mean, mode median, variation


* Recursion and functional programming
* Unfold, Fold, Map
* Ana- and Cata- morphisms


### Programming Practice #3

## Week—5: Files
* A file is a stream of data
* Create, read, update, delete (CRUD)

* Binary or text (but we will only use text files)
* Characters, fields, records


* File encodings
  * ASCII
  * Unicode

The Python Keyword: with
Always prefer this statement for reading and writing files

Built-in functions:
open()
close()
know about these but for now, Do_Not_Use them


### Programming Practice #4


## Week—6: Introducing your project

* IDEs
* Jupyter notebooks
* Pandas, Numpy, MatPlotLib, Seaborn


* Mix code, text and graphics
* Editable
* Executable
* Dynamic
* A handy project diary
* A readable document that makes your work look good
* Machine learning
* Regression analysis
* Cluster analysis


IDEs
Spyder
PyCharm
Pandas
A ‘data analysis and manipulation tool, built on Python’
Numpy

## Week—8: The Application Development Lifecycle
Iterative development
Requirements
Analysis
Design
Build
Test
Evaluate
Project Workshop – your project
Planning your project
Requirements, analysis, design
Designing your tests

Fail fast, learn fast, succeed early
Short iterations
Clear objectives and deliverables
Categorise as: Must, Should, Maybe
Test early and often
Expose to critical review
Recast, and reiterate
Test Driven Development
Requirements, analysis, design, 
Build test framework first
Build application second


## Week—9: Data, Databases, SQL
Data
Structured
Unstructured
Databases
What is a database?
Why use a database?
Types of databases:
Relational, Hierarchical, Object, Unstructured, in-memory, distributed
Relational Databases
SQL – structured query language
The language of relational databases
SQL
DDL data definition language
DML data manipulation language


## Week—10: Project reviews and guidance

Project proposal presentations
Set-up 		= 2 minutes
Presentation	= 3 minutes
Q & A 		= 3 minutes
Wrap-up 	= 1 minute
Tear-down	= 1 minute
Fail fast, learn fast, succeed early

## Week—11: Regular Expressions
What a regular expression is
The RE library
Meta-characters
. ^ $ * + ? { } [ ] \ | ( )
.     Any character except a newline
[ ]  Character class
^    Compliment of class
\    Backslash 
*    Zero or more times
+    One or more times
?    Once or zero times
{m, n}    At least m times and at most n times
|    Logical OR
^    At the beginning of a line
$    At the end of a line
()    Grouping
\A   At the start of a string
\Z   At the end of a string
\B   At a word boundary
\b   Inside a word
(?= …) Positive lookahead assertion
(?! …) Negative lookahead assertion
