LIN7077

Module description
This module introduces computer programming and computational modelling for applications in linguistics. There will be a strong focus on developing practical skills.
Students will learn how to write code in Python3 and gain experience in using tools that are suited to solving a range of computational problems in linguistics.
Learning outcomes: On completion of this module students will be ready to:
•	Design and write programs in Python 3
•	Use the Python standard libraries
•	Understand what values, variables, objects, and functions are and know how to create and use them
•	Programmatically read, process, and write, text and data files
•	Analyse text and report on its statistical properties
•	Search for patterns in texts using regular expressions
•	Present results attractively in graphs and charts
•	Understand the statistical techniques used in machine learning
Students will also have:
•	An understanding of the iterative ‘requirements-analysis-design-build-test-evaluate’ software development process
•	An awareness of recent advances in computer science relevant to linguistics
Module approach
The best way to learn any programming language is to do lots of practice. You will therefore do lots of practical exercises. Expect one each week.
Active participation in class and in our QMPlus Forum is encouraged.
Readings and other learning resources
There are no set books for this module. All the material required is available free on the web. I will post the material for each week’s lesson on QM+.
There are many good books and online resources for learning Python 3. A few I can recommend are:

Coursework assignments and deadlines
You will be assessed on 5 assignments (50%) and one project (%50).
All work must be submitted electronically on QMplus. See the SLLF Student Handbook for information on late penalties and EC claims.
