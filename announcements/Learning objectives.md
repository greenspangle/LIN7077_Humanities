# LIN7077 Programming for the Humanities

# Module description

This module introduces computer programming and computational modelling for
applications in linguistics.

There will be a strong focus on developing practical skills.

Students will learn how to write code in Python and gain experience in using
tools that are suited to solving a range of computational problems in linguistics.

## Learning outcomes:

On completion of this module, students will be able to:

* Design and write programs in Python 3
* Use the Python standard libraries
* Understand what values, variables, functions, and classes are,
  and know how to create and use them
* Programmatically read, process, and write, text and data files
* Analyse text and report on its statistical properties
* Search for patterns in texts using regular expressions
* Present results attractively in graphs and charts
* Understand the statistical techniques used in machine learning
* Understand the ‘agile’ software development process
* Understand recent advances in computer science relevant to linguistics

## Module approach

Programming is a practical activity.

Therefore, to become a decent programmer, you must practice.

Your physical presence and active participation in lectures is therefore essential.

## Learning Materials

I will post the material for each lecture on QM+.

There are no set books for this module, but a few I can recommend are:

* Learn Python in One Day and Learn It Well. J. Chan. LCF Publishing
* Practical Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science Using Python 3. P. Gries, J. Campbell, J.Montojo. Dallas
  and Raleigh: The Pragmatic Bookshelf.
* Python Basics. A Practical Introduction to Python 3. The RealPython.com Tutorial Team. RealPython. www.realpython.com
* Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. A. B. Downey. Download free

* www.w3schools.com/python/
* www.realpython.com
* www.freecodecamp.org/learn/
* www.snakify.org/en/

And last but very far from least:


* Learning Python. Mark Lutz. O'Reilly Media

## Assessment

* The programming activities set
* A programming project of your own choice

TODO - where should this be?
