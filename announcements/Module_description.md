# Programming for the Humanities

## Module code: LIN7077

### Credits: 15.0
### Semester: SEM1

This module provides students with an introduction to computer programming
and computational modelling for language as it is applied in various settings. 
Language processing software and AI now underpin most professions, and an 
understanding of how they work - whether one is in a technical or adjacent 
role - is useful for employability and success. 

The module focuses on the use of programming for data acquisition, cleaning, 
and analysis, particularly with datasets that relate to the Humanities and 
Social Sciences. 

Students will learn how to write code in a widely used programming language
(Python) and understand the role of other languages (e.g. Java, C++, and Rust).
They will gain experience using tools that are suited to solving a 
range of computational problems in linguistics using machine learning 
and other approaches. 

Throughout the module students will develop their practical programming 
experience and complete formative problem sets to reinforce the new material. 

The module is suitable for MA students without any prior experience in 
computer programming or machine learning.
